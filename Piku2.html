            Piku is a strong-willed, sometimes stubborn woman, that juggles her personal and professional life, on top of taking care of her hypochondriac father. Like Priya from Aitraaz, Piku does have a man in her life that plays a major role if her daily choices. Whatâ€™s the difference between them? Piku holds strong boundaries, voices her opinions, and does not sacrifice without second thought for the men in her life. She is not idealized, for instance, moments of her stubbornness show her flaws and portray her to be a more realistic and relatable person. She values and works hard for her professional life, finds enjoyment in her personal life, and attempts to care for her father while maintaining a strong sense of self. There are no unnecessary sexual shots of her, and she is valued for her personality and role in the story just like the men around her.
