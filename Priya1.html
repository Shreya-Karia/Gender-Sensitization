            Raj Malhotra is a product engineer for mobile manufacturing company Voice Mobiles. Junior lawyer Priya Saxena visits his house for an interview, mistaking him as his neighbour friend Barrister Ram Chotrani. Raj develops a love at first sight for Priya, who also accepts him and they get happily married. Two years later, Priya is expecting Raj's child as they settle into their new bungalow, anticipating Raj's CEO promotion. However, on the company's anniversary, Raj is shocked when Sonia, his former lover from Cape Town, now the chairperson, appoints someone else as CEO, leaving Raj on the board of directors.
