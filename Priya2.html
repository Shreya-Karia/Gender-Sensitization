            Aitraaz has two major women characters- Priya (Kareena Kapoor Khan) and Sonia (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), the former is Raj’s (Akshay Kumar) wife, while the latter is his ex lover and boss’s wife. While Priya is initially shown as a career-loving woman, it is sidelined as soon as she gets married. It only resurfaces when she must use her experience as a lawyer to defend her husband in a case of sexual assault. She is depicted to be the ideal woman and partner. On the other hand, Sonia is shown to be a heavily career-oriented model, and a lot of her footage is filled with shots that emphasize her figure and the way men lust after her. She is also portrayed to be a sexually open woman, which apparently leads her to the path of being a bad woman as she eventually gets an abortion to keep her career, tries to woo a married man sexually, and gets furious when she doesn’t get what she wants. The implication is that being a “modern” woman takes you from being sexually open to selfish and manipulative. Priya’s monologue to Sonia mentions that, "Bitch woh hoti hain, jisko apne bacche ke baap ka pata nahi hota." The differences between Priya and Sonia are clear- one is more career-oriented, the other wants kids. One is monogamous, one is not. While there is nothing wrong with either of these things, the movie paints Priya in a positive light while taking Sonia’s modern aspects and manipulating them to absurdity to put them in a negative light (not counting the sexualised shots of her).
